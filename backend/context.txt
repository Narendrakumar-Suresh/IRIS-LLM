Title: The lambda-q calculus can efficiently simulate quantum computers
Authors: Philip Maymin
Summary: We show that the lambda-q calculus can efficiently simulate quantum Turing
machines by showing how the lambda-q calculus can efficiently simulate a class
of quantum cellular automaton that are equivalent to quantum Turing machines.
We conclude by noting that the lambda-q calculus may be strictly stronger than
quantum computers because NP-complete problems such as satisfiability are
efficiently solvable in the lambda-q calculus but there is a widespread doubt
that they are efficiently solvable by quantum computers.

Turing machines by showing how the lambda-q calculus can eﬃc iently sim-
ulate a class of quantum cellular automaton that are equival ent to quantum
Turingmachines. Weconcludebynotingthatthelambda-qcal culusmaybe

computers.
1. Introduction
We show that the λq-calculus deﬁned in [1] can eﬃciently simulate the one-
dimensional partitioned quantum cellular automata (1d-PQCA) deﬁned in [2]. By
the equivalence of 1d-PQCA and quantum Turing machines (QTM) pro ved in [2],
theλq-calculus can eﬃciently simulate QTM.
We assume familiarity with both the λq-calculus and 1d-PQCA as deﬁned in
the above papers.

2. Simulation
To show that 1d-PQCA can be eﬃciently simulated by the λq-calculus, we need
to exhibit a λq-termMfor a given 1d-PQCA Asuch that Aafterksteps is in
the same superposition as MafterP(k) steps, with Pa polynomial.
We assume for now that the 1d-PQCA has transition amplitudes not o ver the
complex numbers, but over the positive and negative rationals. It h as been shown
[4] that this is equivalent to the general model in QTM.
To express AinM, we need to do the following things.
1. Translate states of Aintoλq-terms that can be compared (e.g. into Church
numerals).
2. Translate the acceptance states and the integer denoting the acceptance cell
intoλq-terms.
3. Create a λq-termPto mimic the operation of the permutation σ.
4. Translate the local transition function into a transition term. Fo r 1d-PQCA

5. Determine an injective mapping of conﬁgurations of Aand conﬁgurations
ofM.
Although we will not write down Min full, we note that within Mare the
mechanisms described above that take a single conﬁguration, apply P, and return
the superposition as described by L.
We recall that the contextual closure of the βq-relation is such that M,N→β

It is shown that eﬃcient and robust universal quantum comput ation is possible using the stimu-
lated Raman adiabatic passage with a qubit chain as a pointer register.
PACS numbers: 03.67.Lx,75.10.Pq
A quantum computer (QC) can solve some class of
problems more eﬃciently than any classical computers
can, if we can implement reliable quantum gates and
measurements physically. In general, quantum gates ro-
tate state vectorsthrough someaxis by some angles. The
direction of axis and the amount of angle is determined
by external control signals. The requirements for the ac-
curacy of control signals is very hard in order to fulﬁll
the threshold criterion for fault-tolerant quantum com-
putation.
In ref [1], we proposed a robust method of state trans-
fer and single qubit gate using adiabatic passage along
spin chains [2, 3]. In this proposal, such quantum op-
erations are done using counter-intuitive pulse sequence
which couples neighboring spins. This technique is de-
rivedfromatraditionalmethodofopticalpumpingcalled
the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage(STIRAP). The
ﬁdelity of operation can be made arbitrarily good by the
proper preliminary calibration of coupling Hamiltonian.
However, for universal quantum computation, two qubit
gates must also be made robust. In this paper, we pro-
poseanew methodfordoingarbitrarysequenceof(single
or two qubit) quantum gates with robustness. The key
ingredient is again the adiabatic passage. This method
is basically a variation of the adiabatic quantum com-
putation [4]. However, we must point out that it uses
the zero energy dark state rather than the ground state.
Of course in both cases adiabaticity requires that change
of external parameters must be suﬃciently slow to mini-
mize nonadiabatic transition from the eigenstate to near-
est eigenstates [5]. However, in our scheme the energy
gap between the dark state and neighboring states below
and above scales 1/n, where n is the number of gates
for computation. This means the computation time in-
creasesonlylinearlywith the numberofgates. Ofcourse,
the computation is deterministic. The concept of our
method is suﬃciently general and can be implemented in
various physical systems, e.g., optical lattices, supercon-
ductors, and quantum dots. However, as an example, we
describe an implementation using a system of spin 1/2.
We deﬁne following Hamiltonian system which acts asQC.
H(s) = (1−s)Hinit+sHfinal (1)
Hinit=J(|n+2/angbracketrightc/angbracketleftn+1|+|n+1/angbracketrightc/angbracketleftn+2|)

+M(n/summationdisplay
i=1Ui|i+1/angbracketrightc/angbracketlefti|+U+
i|i/angbracketrightc/angbracketlefti+1|),(3)
where subscript c stands for the state of the counter
(qubit chain of length n+2) and Uiis i-th unitary gate of
quantum computation on the N-qubit computation reg-
ister. We make M much larger than J. Initial state (at
s=0) of the QC is
|s= 0/angbracketrightQC=|0/angbracketrightc|φ/angbracketrightr, (4)
where|φ/angbracketrightris the state encoding the arbitrary input data
of computation. We increases s from 0 to 1 slowly. The
ﬁnal state (at s=1) is
|s= 1/angbracketrightQC=|n+2/angbracketrightcn/productdisplay
i=1Ui|φ/angbracketrightr (5)
At the general value of s (0 < s <1), the state of QC
is
|s/angbracketrightQC= (1−s)J|0/angbracketrightc|φ/angbracketrightr

Note that we need to modulate the strength of cou-
plings only for ﬁrst and last bonds of the counter chain.
Compare above method with other schemes of QC with
a counter [6, 7, 8, 9].
All above results come from the adiabatic approxima-
tion. The validity of the approximation requires that
change of external parameter s must be slow and propor-
tional to the energy gap. Contrary to the conventional
2
adiabatic quantum computations, relevant gaps are be-
tweenzeroenergydarkstateandupperand lowernearest
eigenstates. It is straightforward to obtain that the gap
in our system to be inverseproportionalto the number of
qubits in the counter chain and thus inverse proportional
to the number of gates. The linear dependence of the
gap on the inverse number of gates comes from the sine
(or linear) dependence of eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian
aroundzeroenergy. Ofcoursethere are2Ndegeneracyin
which all possible register states belong to a same level
of the counter among 2nlevels in total. However, this
degeneracy does not contribute to the reduction of adi-
abaticity. The advantage of this scheme is evident; (1)
All unitary operations are embedded preliminarily in the
designed Hamiltonian and do not suﬀer temporal ﬂuctu-
ation which comes from noises in controller system. We
need only to prepare accurate Hamiltonian and an ini-
tial state. We can even calibrate Hamiltonian until it
reaches a satisfactory level of accuracy. (2) Operation
time is proportional to the number of gates, similar to
standard quantum computation using circuit model. (3)
After s has reached 1, answer can be obtained determin-
istically by measuring the register at any time, since the
amplitude of the state encoding correct answer is unity.
There is no need of precise timing of measurement and
the repetition of computation to get a correct answer.
Next we describe the implementation of our scheme
using spin degree of freedom. The QC is described by
H(s) = (1−s)Hinit+sHfinal (7)

Thus, we need four-spin interactions at most. A lim-
iting case of interest is when M is larger than J in many
ordersofmagnitude. Inthiscase,therecreatedalmostno

so in the intermediate circuit nodes of quantum compu-

Title: Duality quantum computer and the efficient quantum simulations
Authors: Shi-Jie Wei, Gui-Lu Long
Summary: In this paper, we firstly briefly review the duality quantum computer.
Distinctly, the generalized quantum gates, the basic evolution operators in a
duality quantum computer are no longer unitary, and they can be expressed in
terms of linear combinations of unitary operators. All linear bounded operators
can be realized in a duality quantum computer, and unitary operators are just
the extreme points of the set of generalized quantum gates. A d-slits duality
quantum computer can be realized in an ordinary quantum computer with an
additional qudit using the duality quantum computing mode. Duality quantum
computer provides flexibility and clear physical picture in designing quantum
algorithms, serving as a useful bridge between quantum and classical
algorithms. In this review, we will show that duality quantum computer can
simulate quantum systems more efficiently than ordinary quantum computers by
providing descriptions of the recent efficient quantum simulation algorithms of
Childs et al [Quantum Information & Computation, 12(11-12): 901-924 (2012)] for
the fast simulation of quantum systems with a sparse Hamiltonian, and the
quantum simulation algorithm by Berry et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 090502
(2015)], which provides exponential improvement in precision for simulating
systems with a sparse Hamiltonian.

1 Introduction
One of us, Long, came to know Dr. Brandt ﬁrst through his importa nt works
in quantum information [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and later his role as ed itor-in-chief
of the journal Quantum Information Processing(QIP). Long pro posed a new
type of quantum computer in 2002 [10], which employed the wave-pa rticle du-
ality principle to quantum information processing. His acquaintance w ith QIP
began in 2006 through the work of Stan Gudder who established the math-
ematical theory of duality quantum computer [11], which was accomp anied
by a diﬀerent mathematical description of duality quantum compute r in the
density matrix formalism [12]. The development of duality quantum co mputer
owes a great deal to QIP ﬁrst in the term of Dr. David Cory as editor -in-chief,
and then the term of Dr. H. E. Brandt as the editor-in-chief. For e xample, the
zero-wave function paradox was pointed out ﬁrstly by Gudder [11], and two
possible solutions were given in Refs. [13] and [14]. Long has actively p artici-
patedintheworkofQIPasareviewerwhenDr.Brandtwastheedito r-in-chief,
and as a member of the editorial board from 2014. At this special oc casion,
it is our great honor to present a survey of the duality quantum com puter in
this special issue dedicated to the memory of Dr. Howard E. Brandt .
As is well-known, a moving quantum object passing through a double-
slit behaves like both waves and particles. The duality computer, or d uality
quantum computer exploits the wave-particleduality ofquantum sy stems [10].
It has been proven that a moving n-qubit duality computer passing through
ad-slits can be perfectly simulated by an ordinary quantum computer w ith
n-qubit and an additional dlevels qudit [15,16,17]. So we do not need to build
a moving quantum computer device which is very diﬃcult to realize. This
also indicates that we can perform duality quantum computing in an or dinary
quantum computer, in the so-called duality quantum computing mode [16,17].
There have been intensive interests in the theory of duality comput er in recent
years [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,2 5,26,27,28,29,30], and
experimental studies have also been reported [31,32].

Quantum circuit.
A quantum circuit is an acyclic network of quantum gates conn ected by wires: the gates represent
quantum operations and the wires represent the qubits on whi ch these operations are performed.
The quantum circuit model is the most commonly studied model of quantum computation.
Quantum complexity class.
A quantum complexity class is a collection of computational problems that are solvable by a cho-
sen quantum computational model that obeys certain resourc e constraints. For example, BQP is
the quantum complexity class of all decision problems that c an be solved in polynomial time by a
quantum computer.
Quantum proof.
A quantum proof is a quantum state that plays the role of a witn ess or certiﬁcate to a quan-
tum computer that runs a veriﬁcation procedure. The quantum c omplexity class QMA is deﬁned
by this notion: it includes all decision problems whose yes- instances are efﬁciently veriﬁable by
means of quantum proofs.
Quantum interactive proof system.
A quantum interactive proof system is an interaction betwee n a veriﬁer and one or more provers,
involving the processing and exchange of quantum informati on, whereby the provers attempt to
convince the veriﬁer of the answer to some computational prob lem.

I Deﬁnition of the subject and its importance
The inherent difﬁculty, or hardness , of computational problems is a fundamental concept in com-
putational complexity theory. Hardness is typically forma lized in terms of the resources required
by different models of computation to solve a given problem, such as the number of steps of a
deterministic Turing machine. A variety of models and resou rces are often considered, including
deterministic, nondeterministic and probabilistic model s; time and space constraints; and inter-
actions among models of differing abilities. Many interesti ng relationships among these different
models and resource constraints are known.
One common feature of the most commonly studied computation al models and resource con-
straint is that they are physically motivated . This is quite natural, given that computers are physical
devices, and to a signiﬁcant extent it is their study that moti vates and directs research on compu-
tational complexity. The predominant example is the class o f polynomial-time computable func-
tions, which ultimately derives its relevance from physica l considerations; for it is a mathematical
abstraction of the class of functions that can be efﬁciently c omputed without error by physical
computing devices.
In light of its close connection to the physical world, it see ms only natural that modern physical
theories should be considered in the context of computation al complexity. In particular, quantum
mechanics is a clear candidate for a physical theory to have the potenti al for implications, if not to
computational complexity then at least to computation more generally. Given the steady decrease
in the size of computing components, it is inevitable that qu antum mechanics will become increas-
ingly relevant to the construction of computers—for quantu m mechanics provides a remarkably
accurate description of extremely small physical systems ( on the scale of atoms) where classical
physical theories have failed completely. Indeed, an extra polation of Moore’s Law predicts sub-
atomic computing components within the next two decades [83 , 78]; a possibility inconsistent with
quantum mechanics as it is currently understood.
That quantum mechanics should have implications to computa tional complexity theory, how-
ever, is much less clear. It is only through the remarkable di scoveries and ideas of several re-
searchers, including Richard Feynman [50], David Deutsch [ 41, 42], Ethan Bernstein and Umesh
Vazirani [30, 31], and Peter Shor [93, 94], that this potenti al has become evident. In particular,
Shor’s polynomial-time quantum factoring and discrete-lo garithm algorithms [94] give strong
support to the conjecture that quantum and classical comput ers yield differing notions of compu-
tational hardness. Other quantum complexity-theoretic co ncepts, such as the efﬁcient veriﬁcation
of quantum proofs, suggest a wider extent to which quantum me chanics inﬂuences computational
complexity.
It may be said that the principal aim of quantum computationa l complexity theory is to un-
derstand the implications of quantum physics to computatio nal complexity theory. To this end, it
considers the hardness of computational problems with resp ect to models of quantum computa-
tion, classiﬁcations of problems based on these models, and t heir relationships to classical models
and complexity classes.

Quantum machine learning may permit to realize more efficient machine learning 
calculations with near -term quantum devices. Among the diverse quantum machine 
learning paradigms which are currently being considered, quantum memristors are 
promising as a way  of combining, in the same quantum hardware, a unitary evolution 
with the nonlinearity provided by the measurement and feedforward. Thus, an efficient 
way of deploying neuromorphic quantum computing for quantum machine learning may 
be enabled.  
 
Introduction  
 
Quantum machine learning is an emerging field inside quantum technologies, which may 
enable to carry out more efficient machine learning calculations with near -term 
quantum devices  [1-4]. It is apparent that a purely quantum unitary evolution is not 
enough for an efficient learning process, which implies irreversibility to some extent  [1,2] . 
Therefore, most quantum learning algorithms imply some variant of the so -called 
quantum -classical protocols, such as variational quantum  eigensolvers  [5-7], quantum 
Boltzmann machines  [8], quantum approximate optimization algorithms  [9], and 
quantum reinforcement learning protocols  [10-14]. Besides the basic digital quant um 
circuit model, all these algorithms include quantum measurements and feedforward in 
some part of the execution , with subsequent further unitary evolution, further classical 
part, and so on.  Usually, one considers a universal quantum computer based on the 
digital paradigm for carrying out all these quantum algorithms. However, it may be 
sensible to employ specialized quantum har dware , which incorporates ab  initio both the 
unitary evolution and the quantum measurement part in the same building block. This is 
what a quantum memristor [15] may  enable.  
 
A quantum memristor [16-20] is a quantum device that is composed of a two -
dimensional quantum system, in the most basic instances, together  with a weak 
measurement and feedforward, in the same basic unit. Its properties are that it can 
sustain a unitary evoluti on, and in the classical limit it behaves with a hysteresis 
dynamics, such as a classical memristor  [21] . Several of these units may be coupled 
together  to form a network of quantum memristors  [22,23], which may be regarded as a 
neuromorphic quantum architecture.  Even though it is not obvious at first sight that this 
quantum paradigm may carry out more efficient quantum computing p rotocols than 
other architectures , it has the basic ingredients of unitary evolution, nonlinearity 
provided by the measurement, and a scalable architecture. Therefore, quantum 
memristors could be useful bricks for quantum machine le arning devices.  
  
Quantum memristors for neuromorphic quantum machine learning  
Machine learning aims at having a computing device that can acquire information from 
the outer world, so called environment, and use that information to improve its 
performance for some task, in each iteration  [24] . This is referred to as  learning from the 
environment. The idea is that interacting with the external world in successive steps, may 
enabl e the machine to improve  its behaviour for the desired task , sometimes even at 
superhuman level  [25] . Even though classical machine learning already works extremely 
well, which is evidenced in the multiple daily life applications we enjoy, it is true that 
processing an increasing amount of data with algo rithms that do not scale optimally for 
this information size is posing a difficulty both in terms of resources and energy 
consumption. Quantum compu ters may be a way forward to scale up machine learning 
computations due to the quantum parallelism, quantum speedup at least for certain 
kinds of problems, and more efficient energy use in the computing process.  However, it 
is not obvious at first sight which , if any,  of the multiple proposed quantum machine 
learning algorithms may be useful in the short or mid -term  for carrying out tasks in better 
or at least complementary ways to existing classical machine learning protocols.  
 
Some of the quantum machine learning protocols rely on the good connection of 
quantum systems to linear algebra, via, e.g., the quantum phase estimation algorithm, 
efficient distance computations, etc  [2]. This kind of algorithms normally rely on a single 
quantum evolution followed by a final measurement. However, they often require a very 
large number of qubits which is not accesible today or in the near future. Other kinds of 
quantum machine learning protocols, which have less rigorous evidence of speedup , but 
nevertheless may be carried out with noisy intermediate -scale quantum computers, are 
included in the paradigm of classical -quantum protocols. This consists  of an iteration of 
several instances of quantum evolution followed by a measurement, where the 
subsequent quantum evolution depends on the outcome of the previous measurement, 
via feedforward . This includes variational quantum eigensolvers, quantum Boltzmann
