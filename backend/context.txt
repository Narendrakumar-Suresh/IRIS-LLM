1 I NTRODUCTION
THERE have been tremendous developments in quantum
computing, quantum cryptography, quantum commu-
nications and the quantum Internet, and we have seen
increased investments and intensive research in quantum
computing in recent years [1], [2]. The quantum Internet wil l
not necessarily replace the (classical) Internet we know an d
use today, at least not in the near future, but can complement
the current Internet. The quantum Internet aims to enable
robust quantum teleportation (or transmission) of qubits,1
and entanglement among qubits,2over long Internet-scale
distances, which are key to many of the quantum protocols
including quantum key distribution, quantum voting, and
others, as well as for non-local control of quantum gates.
There have been efforts to build quantum computers,
and it remains to see if any one paradigm becomes the
dominant or best way of building such quantum comput-
ers. At the same time, even as researchers develop more
powerful quantum computers (supporting more qubits for
operations, and at lower error rates), there is an opportuni ty
for connecting multiple quantum computers from differ-
ent sites to achieve much more complex quantum com-
putations, i.e., inter-linking multiple quantum computer s
on different sites to perform distributed computing with
a distributed system of quantum computers (or quantum
processing units (QPUs) at different nodes), arriving at th e
notion of distributed quantum computing , e.g., [3].
While distributed quantum computing can involve mul-
tiple QPUs next to each other or at the same site, with the
quantum Internet, one can envision distributed quantum

1. A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, and can be
thought of as a two-state, or two-levelled, quantum-mechan ical system,
such as an electron’s spin, where the two levels are spin up an d spin
down, or a photon’s polarization, where the two states are th e vertical
polarization and the horizontal polarization.
2. Multiple qubits at different sites can share an entangled state, a
superpositon of “specially correlated” states, to be used i n distributed
algorithms.computing over nodes geographically far apart. As noted
in [4], the idea is the quantum Internet as the “underly-
ing infrastructure of the Distributed Quantum Computing
ecosystem.”
This article highlights the emerging area of distributed
quantum computing over the quantum Internet, which we
refer to as quantum Internet computing , i.e., the idea of com-
puting using quantumly connected distributed quantum
computers over Internet-scale distances. Hence, quantum
Internet computing is not a new concept in itself but a
proposed “umbrella term” used here for the collection of
topics (listed below), from an analogy to (classical) Inter net
computing.
Internet computing , where one does distributed comput-
ing but over Internet-scale distances and distributed sys-
tems involve nodes connected via the Internet, is at the inte r-
section of work in (classical) distributed computing and th e
(classical) Internet. Analogous to Internet computing, on e
could ask the question of what would be at the intersection
of work in distributed quantum computing and work on the
quantum Internet , which brings us to the notion of quantum
Internet computing .
Also, while the quantum Internet and distributed quan-
tum computing are still nascent research areas, there are at
least three key topics which can be considered as relevant to
quantum Internet computing:
•distributed quantum computing, including quantum
protocols from theoretical perspectives involving
communication complexity studies, and distributed
quantum computing via non-local or distributed
quantum gates,
•quantum cloud computing with a focus on delegat-
ing quantum computations, blind quantum comput-
ing, and verifying delegated quantum computations,
and
•computations and algorithms for the quantum Inter-
net including key ideas such as quantum entangle-
ment distillation, entanglement swapping, quantum

repeaters, and quantum Internet standards.3
We brieﬂy discuss the above topics in the following sections .
2 D ISTRIBUTED QUANTUM COMPUTING
Distributed quantum computing problems and quantum
protocols have been well-studied for over two decades,
from a theoretical computer science perspective,4many of
which have their inspiration from classical distributed co m-
puting research. Quantum versions of classical distribute d
computing problems and protocols, and new forms of dis-
tributed computing using quantum information, have been
explored, e.g., the distributed three-party product probl em,
the distributed Deutsch-Jozsa promise problem and the
distributed intersection problem, demonstrating how, for
some problems, quantum information can enable fewer
bits of communication to be used for a solution, and how
certain distributed computation problems can be solved
with quantum information, but cannot be solved classically .
Many quantum protocols, including quantum coin ﬂipping,
quantum leader election, quantum anonymous broadcast-
ing, quantum voting, quantum Byzantine Generals, quan-
tum secret sharing, and quantum oblivious transfer, can
be viewed as “quantum versions” of classical distributed
computing problems, and have been studied extensively.
Another area of study, which has also been considered
as distributed quantum computing, is non-local gates, or
the non-local control of quantum gates, including early
work nearly over two decades ago.5Key to performing
such non-local control of quantum gates is the use of en-
tanglement, which can be viewed as a resource for such
non-local computations. More recent work has looked at
how to partition the computations of distributed quantum
circuits over multiple QPUs, e.g., [3] as we mentioned earli er
- with considerations including distributing computation s
in such a way as to optimize performance and to reduce the
requirements on entanglement, since if the entanglements
required are generated at too low a rate, this will hold up
computations. The key motivation here is to inter-link a
set of quantum computers to form effectively a much more
powerful quantum computer.
3 Q UANTUM CLOUD COMPUTING AND DELEGAT -
INGQUANTUM COMPUTATIONS
We have seen big tech companies and startups offering
quantum computing as a service similar to accessing other
cloud service offerings, which is a fantastic resource for
experimentation and studies.
More formally, studies into delegating quantum com-
putation from a client (which can be either classical, or
almost classical, i.e., with minimal capability to perform

[last accessed: 1/8/2022]

Jr. in https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0402148.pdf and a
distributed version of Shor’s famous factorization algorit hm
https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05976 [last accessed: 1/8/2 022]computations such as teleporting qubits, applying simple
Pauli quantum operations, and doing basic measurements)
which is much more restricted than the server (assumed
to be a universal quantum computer) have been studied,
called delegated quantum computing . And when the server
is prevented from knowing the client’s inputs but still can
perform delegated computations, by a technique such as
the quantum one-time pad (where the client applies Pauli
operations to add uncertainty from the server’s perspectiv e,
thereby effectively encrypting the quantum inputs it sends
to the server, and keeps track of operations it later needs
to decrypt the outputs from the server), this is called blind
quantum computing.
In order to be sure that the server does indeed perform
the required quantum operations delegated to it by the
client, the client can embed tests (or test runs) into the
delegated computations, so that the server (not being able
to distinguish between tests and normal computations) can
be caught out if it did not perform the required compu-
tations properly. That is, the client can verify if the serve r
performed the required quantum computations.6Further
abstractions for delegating quantum computations with
supporting cloud services continues to be investigated.
4 T HEQUANTUM INTERNET
As we mentioned earlier, work on the quantum Internet
focuses on how to efﬁciently enable robust entanglement
shared among qubits over long geographical distances. If
two nodes in different continents share entangled states,
then, this can be a resource to do non-local gates, i.e.,
to perform distributed quantum computations, and enable
quantum protocols over Internet-scale distances.
There have been the use of satellites to enable long dis-
tance entanglement, as well as the use of optical ﬁbre cables
to demonstrate entanglement. Key to the quantum Internet
are ideas such as entanglement swapping and quantum
repeaters, including ideas such quantum distillation, to
achieve high ﬁdelity distributed entangled states over lon g
distances, and quantum error correction - this continues to
be a research endeavour as mentioned earlier [2].
There are other interesting distributed quantum appli-
cations to be considered including quantum cryptography,
quantum sensing, and quantum positioning systems.

QUANTUM INTERNET : Q UANTUM INTERNET COM-
PUTING AND THE QUANTUM IOT?
Apart from the many quantum computers available over
the cloud by big tech and startups which work at very
low temperatures, room temperature quantum computers
have also started to emerge.7This could pave the way
for quantum computers at the fog and at the edge, not
just in remote clouds, and perhaps even mobile quantum

Abstract: This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantu m computation de-
vices, including fermionic quantum computers and computer s that exploit nonlinear quan-
tum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum comp uting devices can in prin-
ciple compute some quantities more rapidly than ‘conventio nal’ quantum computers.
Computers are physical: what they can and cannot do is determ ined by the laws
of physics. When scientiﬁc progress augments or revises tho se laws, our picture of what
computers can do changes. Currently, quantum mechanics is g enerally accepted as the
fundamental dynamical theory of how physical systems behav e. Quantum computers can
in principle exploit quantum coherence to perform computat ional tasks that classical com-
puters cannot [1-21]. If someday quantum mechanics should t urn out to be incomplete
or faulty, then our picture of what computers can do will chan ge. In addition, the set
of known quantum phenomena is constantly increasing: essen tially any coherent quantum
phenomenon involving nonlinear interactions between quan tum degrees of freedom can
in principle be exploited to perform quantum logic. This pap er discusses how the revi-
sion of fundamental laws and the discovery of new quantum phe nomena can lead to new
technologies and algorithms for quantum computers.
Since new quantum eﬀects are discovered seemingly every day , let’s ﬁrst discuss two
basic tests that a phenomenon must pass to be able to function as a basis for quantum
computation. Theseare1)Thephenomenonmustbenonlinear, and2)Itmustbecoherent.
To support quantum logic, the phenomenon must involve some f orm of nonlinearity, e.g.,
a nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom . Without such a nonlinearity
quantum devices, like linear classical devices, cannot per form even so simple a nonlinear
operation as an AND gate. Quantum coherence is a prerequisit e for performing tasks
such as factoring using Shor’s algorithm [10], quantum simu lation a la Feynman [11] and
Lloyd [12], or Grover’s data-base search algorithm [13], al l of which require extended
manipulations of coherent quantum superpositions.
1
The requirements of nonlinearity and coherence are not only necessary for a phe-
nomenon to support quantum computation, they are also in pri nciple suﬃcient. As shown
in [14-15], essentially any nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom suf-
ﬁces to construct universal quantum logic gates that can be a ssembled into a quantum
computer. In addition, the work of Preskill et al.[18] on robust quantum computation
shows that an error rate of no more than 10−4per quantum logic operation allows one to
perform arbitrarily long quantum computations in principl e.
In practice, of course, few if any quantum phenomena are like ly to prove suﬃciently
controllable to provide extended quantum computation. Pro mising devices under current
experimental investigation include ion traps [5,7], high ﬁ nesse cavities for manipulating
light and atoms using quantum electrodynamics [6], and mole cular systems that can be
made to compute using nuclear magnetic resonance [8-9]. Suc h devices store quantum
information on the states of quantum systems such as photons , atoms, or nuclei, and
accomplish quantum logic by manipulating the interactions between the systems via the
application of semiclassical potentials such as microwave or laser ﬁelds. We will call such
devices ‘conventional’ quantum computers, if only because such devices have actually been
constructed.
There is another sense in which such computers are conventio nal: although the de-
vices described above have already been used to explore new r egimes in physics and to
create and investigate the properties of new and exotic quan tum states of matter, they
function according to well established and well understood laws of physics. Perhaps the
most striking examples of the ‘conventionality’ of current quantum logic devices are NMR
quantum microprocessors that are operated using technique s that have been reﬁned for
almost half a century. Ion-trap and quantum electrodynamic quantum computers, though
certainly cutting edge devices, operate in a quantum electr odynamic regime where the
fundamental physics has been understood for decades (that i s not to say that new and
unexpected physics does not arise frequently in this regime , rather that there is general
agreement on how to model the dynamics of such devices).
Make no mistake about it: a conventional quantum logic devic e is the best kind of
quantum logic device to have around. It is exactly becausethe physics of nuclear magnetic
resonance and quantum electrodynamics are well understood that devices based on this
physics can be used systematically to construct and manipul ate the exotic quantum states
that form the basis for quantum computation. With that recog nition, let us turn to

Quantum computation has the advantage of solving
eﬃciently some problems that are considered intractable
by using conventional classical computation [1]. In this
context, there are two remarkable algorithms found:
Shor’s factoring algorithm [2] and Grove’s search algo-
rithm [3]. But it remains a challenge to ﬁnd eﬃcient
quantum circuits that can perform these complicated
tasks in practice, due to quantum decoherence. A cru-
cial step in the theory of quantum computer has been
the discovery of error-correcting quantum codes [4] and
fault-tolerant quantum computation [5, 6], which estab-
lished a threshold theorem that proves that quantum de-
coherence can be corrected as long as the decoherence is
suﬃciently weak. To tackle this barrier, a revolutionary
strategy, topological quantum computation (see [7] and
references therein), is to make the system immune to the
usual sources of quantum decoherence, by involving the
globally robust topological nature of the computation.
Recently, substantial progressin this ﬁeld has been made
on both theoretical and experimental fronts [8].
In this paper, we provide an alternative approach to
quantum computation from a geometrical view of point.
To this end, we need to reformulate quantum mechanics
via Connes’ noncommutative geometry [9]. In this for-
mulation, quantum states are represented as noncommu-
tative connections, while gauge transformations on the
connections play a role of unitary quantum operations.
In this way, we present a geometrical model for quan-
tum computation, which is equivalent to the quantum
circuit model. In this computational model, information
is encoded in gauge states instead of quantum states and
implementingongaugestatesisplayedbygaugetransfor-
mations. Therefore, our scheme shows a geometric way
of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an
alternative proposal of building a quantum computer.
LetHbe aNdimensional Hilbert space associated
with a ﬁnite quantum system. Let Abe the algebra of
all(bounded) linearoperatorson H,andletU(A) ={u∈
A:uu∗=u∗u=I}withIbeing the unit operator on
H.Given a selfadjoint operator DonH,(A,H,D) is a
spectral triple in the sense of noncommutative geometry
[9, 10]. A (noncommutative) connection on ( A,H,D) is
deﬁned to be a selfadjoint operator VonHof the formthat follows

whereaj,bj∈ Aand [a,b] =ab−ba.A gauge transform
on a connection Vunderu∈ U(A) is deﬁned as
V/ma√sto−→Gu(V) =uVu∗+u[D,u∗]. (2)
For avoiding triviality, we always assume that D/ne}ationslash= 0 or
Iin what follows.
For any (pure) quantum state |ψ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|withψbeing a
unit vector in H,we have
|ψ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|=|ψ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tϕ|i[D,b]|ϕ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|
where i =√−1 and,bis a selfjoint operator on Hsuch
that i[D,b] has eigenvalue 1 at |ϕ/an}bracketri}ht.Such a selfjoint oper-
atorbalways exists because D/ne}ationslash= 0 orI.In this case,
|ψ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|= ia∗[D,ba]−ia∗b[D,a] (3)
witha=|ϕ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|.Thus, every quantum state |ψ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|can
be represented as a connection, denoted by Vψ,i.e.,
Vψ= ia∗[D,ba]−ia∗b[D,a]. (4)
LetGD(H) be the set of all connections Vwhich can
be written as V=Vψ+uDu∗−Dwithψbeing a unit
vector in Handu∈ U(A).An element in GD(H) is said
to be agauge state on (A,H,D).Any quantum state is
necessarily a gauge state, but a gauge state need not to
be a quantum state. However, any gauge state Vcan be
obtained from a quantum state by performing a gauge
transform. Indeed, if V=Vψ+uDu∗−DthenV=
Gu(Vu∗ψ).Moreover, for any gauge state Von (A,H,D)
we have (see [11])
•for anyu∈ U(A), Gu(V) is again a gauge state;
•Guv(V) =Gu(Gv(V)) for allu,v∈ U(A).
Therefore, a gauge transform preserves gauge states.
LetVbe a gauge state which is prepared from a quan-
tum state |ψ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|by operating a gaugetransform Gu,i.e.,

V=Gu(Vψ).For any event E,the probability of Eoc-
curring onVis

Note that a gauge state may be prepared in several ways.
Hence, the probability of a event Eoccurring on a gauge
stateVdepends on the quantum state from which Vis
prepared.
LetHbe a selfadjoint operator on H.Assumingut=
eitHfort∈R,we have that the gauge transforms Vt=
Gt(V) on a ﬁxed gauge state Vunderutform a group
(see [11]), that is,
Gt+s(V) =Gt(Gs(V)). (6)
This yields a dynamical equation governed by the Hamil-
tonianHfor gauge states on ( A,H,D) as follows [12]
idVt
dt= [Vt,H]+[D,H] (7)
withV0=V.In particular, for a unit vector ψwe have
Vt=Gt(Vψ) =Vutψ+utDu∗
t−D. (8)
We now turn to product of two spectral triples. Sup-
pose (Ai,Hi,Di), i= 1,2,are two spectral triple associ-
ated with ﬁnite quantum systems. Put
D=D1⊗I2+I1⊗D2 (9)
withIibeing the unit operator on Hi(i= 1,2). Then
Dis a selfjoint operator on H1⊗H2.The spectral triple
(A1⊗A2,H1⊗H2,D)iscalledthe productoftwospectral
triples (Ai,Hi,Di), i= 1,2.
Now we illustrate our scheme by using a qubit. Let

Then (M2,C2,D) is a spectral triple with D=σx,where
M2is the set ofall 2 ×2complexmatrices. For |0/an}bracketri}ht=/bracketleftbigg
1
0/bracketrightbigg
,
we have
V|0/an}bracketri}ht=/bracketleftbigg
1 0

, Gσx(V|0/an}bracketri}ht) =/bracketleftbigg

and
Gσy(V|0/an}bracketri}ht) =/bracketleftbigg

, Gσz(V|0/an}bracketri}ht) =/bracketleftbigg
1−2

.
For|1/an}bracketri}ht=/bracketleftbigg

,we have

andGσy(V|1/an}bracketri}ht) =/bracketleftbigg

.HenceGσy(V|1/an}bracketri}ht) =Gσz(V|0/an}bracketri}ht) and so, the gauge state
V=/bracketleftbigg
1−2
−2 0/bracketrightbigg
can be prepared in two diﬀerent ways.
We are now ready to interpret quantum computation
from a geometrical view of point. But let us take a
step backward and discuss the standard quantum circuit
model for computation [13]. Let H= (C2)⊗n,the tensor
product of ncopies of C2.A quantum circuit model on
nqubits consists of
•a initial state |ψ/an}bracketri}ht,represented by a unit vector ψ∈

is the projection to |1/an}bracketri}htin the ﬁrst qubit.
LetA=M2n.Put

whereIis the identity on C2.A computational model
based on the spectral triple ( A,H,D) is as follows:
•Initialization of a gauge state Vψin the spectral

•Gauge implementation of the computational pro-
gram
G(Γ) =GUNGUN−1···GU1
where “gates” GUk,1≤k≤N,are gauge transfor-

•Application of the projection operator Π 1for read-

[11]), i.e.,G(Γ)(Vψ) = Γ|ψ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|Γ∗+ΓDΓ∗−D.
Thus, we obtain a geometrical model on nqubits for
quantum computation, which is evidently equivalent to
the quantum circuit model as described above. Due to
the essential role of gauge transformations played in this
computational model, we call this scheme gauge quantum
computation .
As illustration, we give the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
[14] in gauge quantum computation. Let f:{0,1}n/ma√sto→

Title: Quantum Computation and Quantum Information
Authors: Yazhen Wang
Summary: Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in
computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will
likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,
computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally
stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum
computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum
algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo
techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum
computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to
revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be
generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine
random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up
median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This
paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and
quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and
quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much
faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical
framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.

states that the computer power doubles for con-

typographic detail.ventional computer technology, this dream run is
ending. The conventional approaches to the fabrica-
tion of computer technology are to make electronic
devices smaller and smaller in order to increase the
computer power. As the sizes of the electronic de-
vices get close to the atomic scale, quantum eﬀects
are starting to interfere in their functioning, and
thus the conventional approaches run up against the
size limit. One possible way to get around the dif-
ﬁculties is to move to a new computing paradigm
provided by quantum information science. Quantum
information science is based on the idea of using
quantum devices to perform computation and ma-
nipulate and transmit information, instead of elec-
tronic devices following the laws of classical physics,

(1981/82 ). Quantum mechanics and information the-
ory are two of the great scientiﬁc developments and
technological revolutions in the 20th century, and
quantum information science is to marry the two
previously disparate ﬁelds and form a single unify-
ing viewpoint. Quantum information science studies
the preparation and control of the quantum states
of physical systems for the purposes of information
transmission and manipulation. It includes quantum
computation, quantum communication and quan-
tum cryptography. This revolutionary ﬁeld will en-
able a range of exotic new devices to be possible.
There is now a general agreement that quantum in-
formation science will likely lead to the creation of
a quantum computer to solve problems that could
not be eﬃciently solved on a classical computer.
Already scientists have built rudimentary quantum
computers in the research laboratory to run quan-
tum algorithms and perform certain calculations. In-
tensive research eﬀorts are under way around the
world to investigate a number of technologies that
could lead to more powerful and more prevalent
quantum computers in the near future. It is believed
that quantum information and quantum bits are to
lead to a 21st century technological revolution much
as classic information and classic bits did to the
20th century. Since the theory of quantum mechan-
ics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and un-
certainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation
and quantum information. As a result, quantum al-
gorithms are of random nature in the sense that
they yield correct solutions only with some prob-
abilities, and Monte Carlo methods are widely em-
ployed in quantum simulation. Thus statistics has
an important role to play in quantum computation,
quantum simulation and quantum information. On
the other hand, quantum computation and quantum
simulation have tremendous potential to revolution-
ize computational statistics.
A quantum system is generally described by its
state, and the state is mathematically deﬁned to be
a unit vector in some complex Hilbert space. The
number of complex numbers required to characterize
the quantum state usually grows exponentially with
the size of the system, rather than linearly, as occurs
in classical systems. As a consequence, it takes an
exponential number of bits of memory on a classical
computer to store the quantum state, which puts
classical computers in a diﬃcult position to simu-
late a quantum system. On the other hand, nature
quantum systems are able to store and keep track
of an exponential number of complex numbers andperform data manipulations and calculations as the
systems evolve. Quantum information science is to
grapple with understanding how to take advantage
of the enormous information hidden in the quan-
tum systems and to harness the immense potential
computational power of atoms and molecules for the
purpose of performing computation and processing
information. Already it has been shown that quan-
tum algorithms like Grover’s search algorithm and
Shor’s factoring algorithm provide great advantage
over known classical algorithms.
Contemporary scientiﬁc studies often rely on un-
derstanding complex quantum systems, such as those
in biochemistry and nanotechnology for the design
of biomolecules and nano-materials. Quantum sim-
ulation is to use computers to simulate a quantum
system and its time evolution. Classical computers
are being used for quantum simulation in design-
ing novel molecules and creating innovative nano-
products. Quantum computers built upon quantum
systems may excel in simulating naturally occurring
quantum systems, while large quantum systems may
be impossible to simulate in an eﬃcient manner by
classical computers. A quantum system with bdis-
tinct components may be described with bquantum
bits in a quantum computer, while a classical com-
puter requires 2bbits of memory to store its quan-
tum state. This advantage allows quantum comput-
ers to eﬃciently simulate general quantum systems
that are not eﬃciently simulatable on classical com-
puters.
In this article we review the concepts of quantum
computation and introduce quantum algorithms and
quantum simulation. The quantum algorithms are
known to be much faster than the available classi-
cal algorithms. Statistical analyses of quantum al-
gorithms and quantum simulation are provided. We
give a brief description on quantum information.
The article sections start with presentations in broad
brushstrokes, followed by speciﬁc discussions along
with some mathematical derivations if necessary. The
intention is to give each topic ﬁrst an overview and
then a general description and a precise characteri-
zation. It is recommended to focus on the qualitative
discussions but skip the derivations for the readers
who would like to get a quick picture of quantum
computation and quantum simulation.

Title: Probabilistic Process Algebra to Unifying Quantum and Classical Computing in Closed Systems
Authors: Yong Wang
Summary: We have unified quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems
called qACP which is a quantum generalization of process algebra ACP. But, an
axiomatization for quantum and classical processes with an assumption of closed
quantum systems is still missing. For closed quantum systems, unitary operator,
quantum measurement and quantum entanglement are three basic components for
quantum computing. This leads to probability unavoidable. Along the solution of
qACP to unify quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems, we unify
quantum and classical computing with an assumption of closed systems under the
framework of ACP-like probabilistic process algebra. This unification make it
can be used widely in verification for quantum and classical computing mixed
systems, such as most quantum communication protocols.

1. Introduction
Quantum process algebra provides formal tools for modeling, analy sis and veriﬁcation of quantum communi-
cation protocols, which combine quantum communications and quant um computing together. [7] [8] deﬁned
a language called CQP (Communicating Quantum Processes) by adding primitives for quantum measure-
ments and transformation of quantum states to π-calculus. An operational semantics and a type system for
CQP were also presented to prove that the semantics preserves t yping and typing guarantees that each qubit
is owned by a unique process within a system.
[9] [10] [12] [11] deﬁned a language called QPAlg (Quantum Process Alge bra), in which, based on CCS

[2], primitives of unitary transformations and quantum measuremen ts were added to CCS. An operational
semantics based on probabilistic branching bisimulation was given in QPA lg.
qCCS[13]wasintroducedasakindofalgebraofpurequantumproce sses(noclassicaldatainvolved)based
on CCS. qCCS aimed at providing a suitable framework, in which the mec hanism of quantum concurrent
computation can be understood, and interactions and conjugatio n of computation and communication in
quantum systems can be observed. In qCCS, quantum operations (super operators) were chosen to describe
transformations of quantum states, and quantum variables and t heir substitutions were carefully treated.
An operational semantics for qCCS based on exact (strong) bisimu lation and an approximation version of
bisimulation were presented for qCCS. Based on [13], several kind of bisimulations were presented for qCCS,
such as probabilistic bisimulation[6], a kind of weak probabilistic bisimulatio n[15], open bisimulation [16]
and symbolic bisimulation [14] [17]. These bisimulations provided qCSS with more semantic models. In some
bisimulations, not only pure quantum data, but also classical data co uld be involved in qCCS.
Several years ago, we proposed an axiomatization of quantum pro cesses called qACP [19], which is a
quantum generalization of process algebra ACP [4]. This work uses so me results of the previous works,
especially qCCS, in the following ways. (1) qACP still uses the concept of a quantum process conﬁguration
which is widely used in quantum process algebra area ⟨p,̺⟩[6] [9] [10] [7] [8] [13] [15] [6] [17], which is
usually consisted of a process term pand quantum state information ̺of all (public) quantum information
variables. (2) Like qCCS, quantum system is treated as an open sys tem, and quantum operations are chosen
to describe transformations of quantum states, and behave as t he atomic actions of a pure quantum process.
Quantum measurements are treated as quantum operations, so p robabilistic bisimulations are avoided. In
qACP, quantum and classical computing are uniﬁed with the same equ ational logic and the same structured
operationalsemantics based on process conﬁguration.Unlike CCS [2] and CSP [3], ACP-like process algebras
[4] are logic on actions, and data are hidden behind actions [1]. For qAC P, it is the duty of atomic actions –
quantum operations and atomic quantum communication actions, to obey the rules of quantum mechanics,
such as the non-cloning theorem (it is also suitable for ACP-like proba bilistic process algebra in this paper).
But, qACP relies on the assumption of an open quantum system and is not suitable for a closed quantum
system. For a closed quantum system, the basic two quantum oper ations are unitary operator and quantum
measurement,sothe probabilityareunavoidable.ThanksforAndo va’sACP-likeprobabilisticprocessalgebra
[5], we go long the solution of qACP for an open quantum system to unif y quantum and classical computing
for a closed quantum system by use of ACP-like probabilistic process algebra.
Fortunately, quantum and classical computing in closed systems ar e uniﬁed with Andova’s ACP-like
probabilistic process algebra, which has the same equational logic an d the same structured operational se-
mantics based on quantum conﬁguration. There are several innov ations in this paper, we enumerate them as
follows. (1) With the assumption for a closed quantum system, we so lve the modeling of the three main com-
ponents in a closed quantum system: unitary operator, quantum m easurement and quantum entanglement,
with a full support for quantum and classical computing in closed sys tems. (2) We still use the framework
of a quantum process conﬁguration ⟨p,̺⟩, and let the quantum part ̺be the outcomes of execution of pto
examine and observe the function of the basic theory of quantum m echanics. We establish the relationship
between probabilistic quantum bisimilarity and classical probabilistic bis imilarity, including strong proba-
bilistic bisimilarity and weak probabilistic bisimilarity, which makes an axioma tization of quantum processes
possible. With this framework, quantum and classical computing mixe d processes are uniﬁed with the same
structured operational semantics. (3) We establish a series of ax iomatizations of quantum process algebra,
including Fully ProbabilisticQuantum Basic processalgebra fpqBPA , Basic Quantum ProcessAlgebrawith
Probabilistic Choice pqBPA, Probabilistic Basic Quantum Process Algebra with Projection pqBPA+PR,
Probabilistic Quantum Variant of ACP pqACP+, Fully Probabilistic Quantum Process Algebra with Ab-
stractionfpqBPA τ, and some extensions, including an extension for quantum entangle mentpqACP+
QE, for
renamingpqACP+
RN, for priorities pqACP+
Θ. These process algebras support nearly all main computation
properties. (4) In this paper, quantum and classical computing in c losed quantum systems are uniﬁed with
the same equational logic and the same structured operational se mantics under the framework of ACP-like
probabilistic process algebra. This uniﬁcation means that our work c an be used widely for veriﬁcation for
quantum and classical computing mixed systems, for example, most quantum communication protocols.
(5) ACP-like axiomatization also inherits the advantages of ACP, for example, modularity makes it can be
extended in an elegant way.
This paper is organizedas follows. In section 2, we introduce some pr eliminaries,including basic quantum
mechanics, and especially a brief introduction to Andova’s ACP-like pr obabilistic process algebra. Respec-
